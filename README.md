 # listen_event_key_press

This C++ code defines two functions, `listen_event_key_press` and `event_key`, to capture a key press event using the `choice` command and check if a specific key was pressed. It also includes a `stop_listening` function to delete a temporary file created during the process.

## `listen_event_key_press` Function

The `listen_event_key_press` function takes two parameters:

- `default_key`: A single character representing the default choice if no input is received within the specified time.
- `time`: A number representing the time in seconds during which the user can make a choice.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this function works:

1. It constructs a command string using the `choice` command. The command string includes the following options:
   - `/c`: Specifies the characters that the user can choose from. In this case, it includes all lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers 0-9, and the default key.
   - `/n`: Disables the display of the command prompt.
   - `/t`: Specifies the time limit for user input.
   - `/D`: Specifies the default key.

2. It executes the constructed command using the `system()` function. This command will display a temporary console window where the user can press a key within the specified time limit.

3. It reads the output from the temporary file named "temp.tmp." This file contains the key that the user pressed or the default key if no input was received within the time limit.

4. It returns the content of the temporary file as a string.

## `event_key` Function

The `event_key` function takes two parameters:

- `input_key`: The key that the user pressed, obtained from the `listen_event_key_press` function.
- `wanted_key`: The key that we want to check if it was pressed.

This function simply checks if the `input_key` matches the `wanted_key`. If they match, it returns `1`, indicating that the desired key was pressed. Otherwise, it returns `0`.

## `stop_listening` Function

The `stop_listening` function is used to delete the temporary file "temp.tmp" that was created by the `listen_event_key_press` function. This function
